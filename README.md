# 👋 Hi, I’m Melissa

- 👩‍💻 Senior Front-End Engineer & Technical Lead based in Montréal, Canada.
- 🏢 Currently working at a global digital agency specializing in composable e-commerce.

## 🧠 What I do

- Design scalable, high-performance, and maintainable front-end architectures, with a strong focus on accessibility, testing, and code quality.
- Build and maintain design systems and component libraries to support consistent UI development.
- Ensure secure and consistent data handling across micro frontends and API layers integrated from headless services.
- Implement edge rendering, server-side rendering, and secure data strategies.
- Lead teams in delivering composable front-end solutions and defining integration patterns.
- Align API contracts with front-end requirements and contribute to MACH/composable architecture transformations.
- Define CI/CD workflows, observability standards, and monitoring for production-ready applications.

I am always exploring new front-end tools, and mentoring others to build better developer experiences.

Currently diving into AI tooling to explore how it can enhance developer workflows and team productivity.
